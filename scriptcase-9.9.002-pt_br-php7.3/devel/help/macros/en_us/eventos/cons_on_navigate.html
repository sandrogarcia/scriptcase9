			<p>In the query application, this event runs in two situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>When configured with partial paging, the event is executed when navigating between pages using the <strong>navigation buttons</strong>, <strong>navigation by page</strong> or the <strong>Jump to</strong> option.</li>
<li>When configuring the application with <strong>Infinite Scroll</strong>, it is executed every time records are loaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike other events, this one depends on user interaction to be triggered, allowing, for example, that any validation or layout change is performed only after this interaction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>The query navigation is performed by ajax, thus, it is not possible to use Javascript codes (JQuery, Ajax).</p>
<p>When using full paging in the application, the event is not executed.</p>
