			<p>This event occurs after form validation (onValidate and onValidateSuccess), when clicking the Delete button, and before executing the SQL command to delete the record in the database.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<p>As examples we can see in the example below, we consult a user privileges table before deleting the record, if it does not have such privilege, we send an error message.</p>
<p>sc_lookup(priv_del," select priv_del from tb_privileges where login = [var_login] ");</p>
<p>if({priv_del[0][0]} != 'YES'){</p>
<p>  sc_error_messagem(" you do not have privileges to perform this operation ");</p>
<p>}</p>
