			<p>This event occurs after clicking the Delete button on the <strong>multi-record form</strong>. The form will execute the onValidate and onValidateSuccess events, then it will execute the <strong>onBeforeDeleteAll</strong> event before starting the execution of the SQL commands to delete records in the database.</p>
<p><em>Note: This event is triggered only once, regardless of the amount of lines removed in one click on the Delete button.</em></p>
<p>Â </p>
<hr />
<p>As examples we can see in the example below, we consult a user privileges table before deleting the record, if it does not have such privilege, we send an error message.</p>
<p>sc_lookup(priv_del," select priv_del from tb_privileges where login = [var_login] ");</p>
<p>if({priv_del[0][0]} != 'YES'){</p>
<p>sc_error_message(" you do not have privileges to perform this operation ");</p>
<p>}</p>
