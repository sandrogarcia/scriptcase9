			<p>It is the first event executed in the application, being fired even before the SQL and HTML assembly.</p>
<p>It works as a preparation for the application, where it is possible, among other things, to manipulate variables, perform validations and change the connection with the <code>sc_change_connection</code> macro, for example.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the example below, access to the edit form (form_orders) linked to the query will be limited, depending on the user who is accessing the application.</p>
<p>If the variable <code>[usr_login]</code> is equal to <strong>admin</strong>, the user will have access to the form with the possibility of inserting and deleting a record.</p>
<p>If the variable has some other value, the user will still have access to the form, but only with the possibility of changing a record.</p>
